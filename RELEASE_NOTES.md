# TON Wallet Intelligence Dashboard — v0.22.7 INTERVAL COVERAGE

This release adds deterministic multi-run interval coverage diagnostics to the
existing wallet history-readiness response. It measures only revalidated,
bounded acquisition evidence from the selected runs and never promotes a
selected span to complete or global wallet history.

## Release scope

- `analysis_version: wallet_history_readiness_v0.22.7` now exposes
  `bounded_interval_coverage` under contract
  `wallet_multi_run_interval_coverage_v1`.
- The request still requires one explicit target run and 2-50 distinct run ids
  for the same wallet identity and data mode.
- Every selected run is classified independently in each coverage layer as
  `included`, `excluded`, or `not_requested`, with its recorded evidence state
  and rejection reason preserved.
- Accepted intervals use exact half-open UTC semantics: `[start, end)`.
- Durations are calculated with integer microseconds and serialized as
  canonical decimal strings. No floating-point, browser safe-integer, or
  whole-second rounding can hide a one-microsecond gap.
- A deterministic boundary sweep reports accepted intervals, their union,
  adjacency, overlap segments and depth, and internal gap segments.
- Time before the earliest eligible start and at or after the latest eligible
  end remains `unknown`.

## Strict evidence revalidation

Coverage is not derived from stored start/end fields alone. History readiness
first revalidates every selected run's persisted stream and page evidence:

- low-level transaction coverage accepts only one coherent bounded
  `transactions` stream in validated `complete` state;
- provider-display coverage accepts only one coherent bounded `account_events`
  stream in validated `provider_stream_complete` state;
- stream contract, provider, scope, query filters, sort order, page sequence,
  cursors, counts, digests, bounds, completion reason, errors, and run scope must
  satisfy the existing fail-closed page-evidence validators;
- missing, ambiguous, malformed, incomplete, preview-only, legacy, or otherwise
  ineligible evidence is excluded rather than repaired or inferred;
- a surface that was not requested is reported separately as `not_requested`
  and is never silently counted as an excluded or covered interval.

## Two separate coverage layers

The contract contains two layers that are never combined:

1. `low_level_transactions` measures validated low-level transaction-query
   intervals.
2. `provider_display_events` measures validated TonAPI account-event display
   intervals.

`cross_stream_union_applied` is always false. A gap in one layer cannot be
filled by evidence from the other layer, and overlap between the layers has no
coverage meaning. TonAPI event actions remain mutable, display-only provider
interpretations; even contiguous `provider_display_events` coverage is not
authoritative transfer, swap, or activity history.

## Interval semantics

For each layer, the response exposes:

- accepted per-run intervals and the normalized union;
- a selected span from the earliest eligible start to the latest eligible end;
- exact covered, gap, overlap, and span durations as canonical decimal
  microsecond strings;
- overlap segments with contributing run ids and coverage depth;
- internal gap segments with the eligible run ids on each side;
- included, excluded, and not-requested run ids plus per-run evidence reasons;
- `contiguous_selected_span`, `gapped_selected_span`, or
  `no_validated_intervals` state.

Touching half-open intervals are adjacent and form one contiguous union.
Overlapping intervals contribute coverage only once to the union, while their
overlap duration and maximum depth remain visible. Gaps are reported only
inside the earliest-to-latest eligible span; the contract makes no statement
about time outside it.

## UI

The wallet workspace includes a selected-run history-readiness card. The
current run is the explicit target, and the user supplies the remaining run ids
for a total of 2-50 distinct selected runs. The card keeps transaction and
provider-display interval summaries separate and shows included, excluded,
not-requested, overlap, and internal-gap evidence without a full-history claim.

## Migration and compatibility

v0.22.7 adds no database migration. Alembic head remains
`20260710_0005`. The v0.22.6 provider event/action observation identity
contract `tonapi_event_action_obs_v1`, transaction identity, and persisted
acquisition evidence remain unchanged.

Legacy or malformed stream evidence is not synthesized into interval coverage.
It is represented through explicit per-layer exclusion or not-requested state.

## Explicitly unchanged

- No transaction or event rows are merged across runs.
- No cross-run or semantic deduplication is applied.
- No complete pre-run, global, or full wallet history is established.
- No acquisition cost basis or PnL input is created.
- Provider-display event actions remain non-authoritative.
- `full_pre_run_history_established`, `complete_wallet_history_established`,
  `is_global_history_coverage`, `is_authoritative_activity_coverage`,
  `activity_rows_merged`, `deduplication_applied`, `is_cost_basis`,
  `eligible_for_cost_basis`, and `used_by_pnl` remain false.
- Backend `VERSION=0.2.1` remains the API-version field; `v0.22.7 INTERVAL
  COVERAGE` is the product label.

## Verification

```bash
cd backend
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q

cd ../frontend
npm run build
```

Verification must cover strict stream/page revalidation, 2-50 distinct selected
run ids, exact one-microsecond boundaries, adjacency, nested and multi-run
overlap, internal gaps, excluded and not-requested runs, independent layer
results, unknown outside-span coverage, and unchanged false merge/history/
cost/PnL flags. No credential may appear in logs, warnings, persisted evidence,
errors, exports, or UI copy.
